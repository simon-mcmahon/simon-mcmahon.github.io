Hello there! 

I'm Simon, a Gold Coast based Level 2 IT Support Officer with a background in applied mathematics. 

I'm building skills for a career in blue team cybersecurity.

In my free time I like hiking 🥾 and disc golf 🥏.

### Day to day work

I currently work at **Billabong Australia** where we support a mixed retail and corporate environment. 

I handle Level 2 tickets, small projects, and security focused work across endpoint, identity, and networked systems. 

Day to day, I work with tools and platforms like:

* Microsoft 365 (Entra ID, Exchange Online, Teams Admin)
* Microsoft Intune
* Endpoint Central
* Microsoft Defender for Endpoint / Identity / Office 365
* Jira
* Darktrace
* Cisco Meraki
* Palo Alto Firewalls / GlobalProtect VPN

Here you will find blog posts about my learning and projects.

I'm always studying, tinkering and evolving my skills, so follow my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-mcmahon) or read my [Resume](/resume) for more.
