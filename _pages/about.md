Hi! I'm Simon McMahon - an aspiring Network Engineer (and recovering pure math graduate). 

I'm currently studying a [Diploma of IT (Advanced Networking and Cloud Engineering)](https://tafeqld.edu.au/courses/19032/diploma-of-information-technology) at TAFE QLD & revising for my [CompTIA Network+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/network) Certification.

Here you will find posts about my learning, self-hosting & coding projects! With the goal being getting a job in the IT sector.

In my free time I like hiking & running.
